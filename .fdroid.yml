AutoName: Navit
Description: |-
    Its modular design is capable of using vector maps of various formats for
    routing and rendering of the displayed map. Itâ€™s even possible to use multiple
    maps at a time. While Navit supports all major platforms, there is a fork
    specializing on an easy-to-use, Android-only solution:
    https://f-droid.org/packages/com.zoffcc.applications.zanavi.

    The routing engine not only calculates an optimal route to your destination, but
    also generates directions and even speaks to you.

    Navit currently speaks 27 languages. You can help translating via the web-based
