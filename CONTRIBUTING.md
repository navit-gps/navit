## Submitting patches

We are very happy that you like to participate and help the [[team]] to improve Navit :) To make this teamwork a pleasure for all, we will try to guide you trough this process:

### Preparation

Make sure you are familar with our (development tips)[https://wiki.navit-project.org/index.php/Development], learned about the codebase and our guidelines.
If you found a bug, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/navit-gps/navit/issues) and bring up all details so others can check them and help you on isolating the defective code.
Point out that you like to submit a patch.

### Process

 * Fork the [Github repository](https://github.com/navit-gps/navit) and clone it using `git clone`
 * Find the bug (and please address only one issue per patch!) and try to fix it
 * Test test test if still compiles and the behaviour is as expected
 * Think about possible side effects (as performance, different settings, ...)
 * Get the newest Git Navit version (see [this documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork) on how to sync your fork) and apply your changes once more
 * Test if everything still works fine
 * [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on github
 * Wait to verify that all the tests in our CI finish successfully


### Review

It might take some time until somebody reviews the pull request (maybe try to reach out using one of the various ccontact methods [listed in the wiki](https://wiki.navit-project.org/index.php/Contacts)).
If your changes are more complex, catch up new ideas, or still have some minor problems, it might be discussed and we might ask you to submit an updated version/adapt your changes.

So that's it, you helped Navit to go one step forward. Thank you very much :)
