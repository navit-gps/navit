Submitting patches
==================

We are very happy that you like to participate and help the
`team <team>`__ to improve Navit :) To make this teamwork a pleasure for
all, we will try to guide you trough this process:

preparations
------------

Make sure you are familar with our `development <development>`__,
learned about the codebase and our guidelines. If you found a bug,
please open a `Trac <Trac>`__ ticket and bring up all details so others
can check them and help you on isolating the defective code. Point out
that you like to submit a patch.

process
-------

#. Clone the codebase via
   `GitHub <https://github.com/navit-gps/navit>`__
#. Find the bug (and please address only one issue per patch!) and try
   to fix it
#. Test test test if still compiles and the behaviour is as expected
#. Think about possible side effects (as performance, different
   settings, ...)
#. Get the newest Git Navit version and apply your changes once more
#. Test if everything still works fine
#. `Create an pull
   request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/>`__
   on github

review
------

It might take some time until somebody reviews the pull request (maybe
give a ping via `Contacts <Contacts>`__). If your changes are more
complex, catch up new ideas, or still have some minor problems, it might
be discussed and we might ask you to submit an updated version/adapt
your changes.

So that's it, you helped Navit to go one step forward. Thank you very
much :)
