Dependencies
============

**Be sure to check the prerequisites before building.**

Note that most prerequisites are optional, meaning Navit will build
without them, but you may find that you have some crucial features
missing such as the GUI.

Prerequisites are operating-system dependent:

-  `OpenSuse dependencies <OpenSuse_dependencies>`__
-  `Gentoo dependencies <Gentoo_dependencies>`__
-  `Debian dependencies <Debian_dependencies>`__
-  `Ubuntu dependencies <Ubuntu_dependencies>`__
-  `Fedora dependencies <Fedora_dependencies>`__
-  `Windows <Windows>`__

In general you will need one of ``ksvgtopng``, ``rsvg-convert`` or
``Inkscape`` to build pre-scaled icons in the xpm directory - the build
process will detect if you have one of those installed, and warn you
otherwise.

Please see platform specific sections such as Nokia N8x0 for their
additional development environment dependencies.
