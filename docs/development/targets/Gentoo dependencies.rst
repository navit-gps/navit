There is a Gentoo ebuild for navit in Gentoo's Bugzilla :
http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=176552

If you want, you can vote for it so it gets included in portage :
http://bugs.gentoo.org/votes.cgi?action=show_user&bug_id=176552#vote_176552

You can also try the ebuild in the overlay : `sunrise
overlay <http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/sunrise/>`__.The ebuild is based
on the svn to have the latest version of navit
