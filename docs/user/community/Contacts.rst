========

You can contact Navit `team <team>`__ and frequent users for help or
advice through a variety of methods. Though you can use any of the
methods below, but Discord/IRC will probably result the quickest
response.

Rules
~~~~~

-  **Use English**. Whilst not a hard-and-fast rule, there are a variety
   of nationalities represented within the channel, and English has been
   chosen as the primary language of communication. If your English is
   non-existant (then how are you reading this?!) then try to ask in
   your native language, but don't expect to be answered in a timely
   manner (unless it's German...)
-  **Be patient**. There are usually a lot of people logged in, but most
   of these people are not constantly monitoring the channel. Ask a
   question, then wait patiently for a reply. If you know the person to
   which your questions should be directed, include their nickname in
   your message so that their chat window is highlighted.
-  **Use the logs**. If your question is not answered before you have to
   logoff, leave a message to say that you'll check the logs and
   hopefully someone will reply later on.
