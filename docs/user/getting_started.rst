Getting Started
===============

Demo
----
.. warning::
    TODO: Build web based demo of navit with webassembly
Before you begin installing, configuring and using Navit we would like to take you on a webbased Demo of Navit in action.
It will show you how Navit **can** look and function.
Just head over to `Navit Online <TBD>`__ and try it yourself

Installation
------------
Before starting with Navit you need to get Navit installed on your System.
For instructions how to get started you should look at :doc:`platforms/index`

Configration
------------
The most difficult task on setting up Navit is its configuration.
The configuration is mostly done with xml-Files.
We have seperated this section into two Parts to get you on the track.

1) :doc:`configuration/basic` is to get you started on how the Navit configuration is working.
2) :doc:`configuration/advanced` is there to tell you everything about the additional possibilities Navit can provide.
