Windows Integration
###################

For Windows there exists the tool `tell_navit.exe` which is bundled with navit.
It can control a running navit instance from the outside, but this only works on windows System.
To use it, you need to run it from the commandline. The needed arguments can be found from its help.


The valid navit_command's are the same as described here: :doc:`/user/configuration/advanced/navit_commands`
