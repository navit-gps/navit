An article about navit can be found in the

In general you can download the software according to the instructions

packages <http://download.navit-project.org/navit/openmoko/svn/>`__. You
have to add the navit repository (feed), update and install navit with
opkg.

An other option without compiling navit is to follow the instructions in
the `SHR User Manual <http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/SHR_User_Manual>`__
of the SHR distribution for your freerunner. SHR is one of the available
`distributions <http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/Distribution>`__ on your
freerunner.

-  You can flash the memory of your freerunner with the SHR distribution
   and install Navit with the installer opkg

`` opkg install navit ``

-  For further details follow the instructions in the `SHR User
   Manual <http://wiki.openmoko.org/wiki/SHR_User_Manual>`__
