methods below, but the IRC channel will probably result the quickest
response.

Setup
~~~~~

As of late July, 2018, Freenode requires verification of user accounts
(possibly in reaction to some spam incident). They have
`instructions <https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration>`__ for this.
In short:

-  Connect with the nick of your choice but no authentication. You will
   get a message saying that you need to be identified with services.
-  Enter the following (replacing ``password`` with a password of your
   choice):

   ``/msg NickServ REGISTER password youremail@example.com``

-  Check your email. You will receive a confirmation message with
   another line to type into the same chat session.
-  Now configure your IRC client to authenticate. The recommended method
   is SASL, for which Freenode has
   `instructions <https://freenode.net/kb/answer/sasl>`__ available.

Rules
~~~~~

-  **Use English**. Whilst not a hard-and-fast rule, there are a variety
   of nationalities represented within the channel, and English has been
   chosen as the primary language of communication. If your English is
   non-existant (then how are you reading this?!) then try to ask in
   your native language, but don't expect to be answered in a timely
   manner (unless it's German...)
-  **Be patient**. There are usually a lot of people logged in, but most
   of these people are not constantly monitoring the channel. Ask a
   question, then wait patiently for a reply. If you know the person to
   which your questions should be directed, include their nickname in
   your message so that their chat window is highlighted.
-  **Use the logs**. If your question is not answered before you have to
   logoff, leave a message to say that you'll check the logs and
   hopefully someone will reply later on.
