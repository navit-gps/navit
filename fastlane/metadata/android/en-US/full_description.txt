Navit for Android is an open source (GPL) car navigation system.
It will display your position on a map (in bird-view mode or as a 3D "visualization") from GPS sensor data, and can provide precise route calculation, touch screen functionality and supports Points of Interest (POI).

Unlike other navigation systems, Navit maps are dynamically generated in real time from vector data.
Navit is completly offline and works without an internet connection. Navit respects your privacy and does not track your position.

Features:
*) Navigate to target from google maps
*) works offline
*) spoken directions in many languages
*) uptodate OSM maps
