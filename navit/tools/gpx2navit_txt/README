What's This
===========
  gpx2navit_txt is a converter from GPX file to Navit Text map format

For gpx2navit_txt was the original code from gpx2shp used and modified.
This is a output of Metro Manila Transit Map Project by JOCV (Japan
Overseas Cooperation Volunteers) program of JICA (Japan International
Cooperation Agency in 2004. It is provided you on GPL2.

Compilation/Installation
========================
run ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
run make install if you want the binary to be installed in your system.
run make uninstall to wipe everything related.

How to Use
==========
- Basic
  There are three types of data on GPX that are waypoint, trkpoint and
route. gpx2navit_txt converts the  data to navit file(s)
Please try to convert a sample file "pinatest2.gpx" in this archive.

    prompt> gpx2navit_txt pinatest2.gpx
    prompt> ls
    pinatest2.gpx       (source gpx)
    pinatest2_meta.txt  (meta data may be there)

  You can convert only a certain type of data like only waypoint or
track point using option '-w' (waypoint), '-t' (trackpoint) or '-r'
(route).

    prompt> gpx2navit_txt -r pinatest2.gpx

- Convert path data to points and etc
  As default, track point and route data is converted as a arc data but
you can convert it other ways using option '-p'(convert as point) and
'-e' (as edge). The edge file has '_edg' in the filename and the point
file has '_pnt' in the filename.

    prompt> gpx2navit_txt -p -e pinatest2.gpx

- Statistics
  If you add '-s' option you can see a conversion summery.

    prompt> gpx2navit_txt -s pinatest2.gpx
    Track Points:
            track count:    4
            point count:    658
            total length:   156565.627989
            unconverted:    0( 0.00%)
    Routes:
            route count:    1
            point count:    323
            total length:   9258.618971
            unconverted:    0( 0.00%)
    Waypoints:
            point count:    118

- Noise reduction
  gpx2navit_txt has several thresholds to reduct the noise path data. The
value can set as '--min-points', '--min-length' and '--min-time'. Please
try a example below.

    prompt> gpx2navit_txt --min-points 6 -s pinatest2.gpx
    gpx2navit_txt:../pinatest3.gpx:3962 track was not converted because of
    less then 6 points. (<- this path is not converted because the path
    has only 5 points)
    Track Points:
            track count:    3
            point count:    653
            total length:   156439.490642
            unconverted:    1(25.00%)
    Routes:
            route count:    1
            point count:    323
            total length:   9258.618971
            unconverted:    0( 0.00%)
    Waypoints:
            point count:    118


- Length and time units
  You can choose any length related units that are supported by proj4
for attribute table using
    '--length-unit'		(for length column, default: m),
    '--time-unit'		(for time column, default: sec),
    '--speed-length-unit'	(for speed column, default: km),
    '--speed-time-unit'		(for speed column, default: hour) and
    '--length-ellipsoid'	(for length calculation, default: UGS84).
  You can see the supported units by 'geod -lu' and 'geod -le' command.
  Supported time unit are 'sec', 'min', 'hour' and 'day'.

- Other futures
  There are other futures in gpx2navit_txt. Please check the option list using

    gpx2navit_txt --help
