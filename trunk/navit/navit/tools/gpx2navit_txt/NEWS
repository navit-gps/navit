 - Add configure script etc.
 - Get rid of some warnings about loosing the 'const'-ness of the
   variable.
 - Remove unused include <math.h>.
 - Add include to find prototype for geod_set().
 - Fix handling of output filename, to make sure it handles
   './foo.gpx' (used to give random filename).
 - Correct the prototype of closeFiles().
 - Add files in debian/ to make debian package.  This is just a
   framework, and need more work.  The package description and a lot
   of the support files are from the dh-make package, and should be
   edited or removed.  To build the package, run debuild from the
   devscripts package.
 - Solve some memory leaks and complaints.
